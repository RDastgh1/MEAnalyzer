# MEAnalyzer
Analyze spike train data exported from multi-electrode array recordings with advanced visualizations.
This stand-alone tool gives you the ability to:
  - Load spike trains from a variety of electrode layouts
  - Select electrodes from a graphical display
  - Crop time segments
  - Calculate electrode-specific metrics for spike activity
  - Plot and export raster plots in publication-ready format
  - Plot plate-wide activity with a bin size of your choosing
  - Calcualte bursts based on your own burst definition
  - Calculate periodic intervals for plate-wide activity
  - Calculate and visualize network correlation activity
  - Export 3D visualizations
  
All parameters are adjustable
